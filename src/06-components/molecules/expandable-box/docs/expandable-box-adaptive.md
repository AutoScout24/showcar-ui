Expandable boxes are CSS-only implementation. Thus, you have to follow the markup structure. In other words, it is important to keep class structure like it is shown in the examples.  
Note: You can spot H3 and H5 tags being used here. You can use any element according to the requirements as long as you have `.sc-expandable-box__title` class in place.  

The adaptive version of expandable box is opened on devices with 768px and higher screen width. On smaller devices it has a clickable arrow to expand the box.
