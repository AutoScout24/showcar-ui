<h2>Breadcrumbs<span class="status approved">Approved</span></h2>

By default on views less than 500px only the last breadcrumb is shown. If you want to show another one add `sc-breadcrumbs--viewport-s` to `<ul>` element and `sc-breadcrumb-item--viewport-s` to `<li>` element you want to keep visible.
