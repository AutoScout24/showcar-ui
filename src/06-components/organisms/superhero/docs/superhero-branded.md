 <h2>Superhero<span class="status approved">Approved</span></h2>

 This is the new Superhero. It replaces the old one (see below). The main difference is the orange border above the headline.
 
 The superhero enables the author to display a variety of different elements (e.g. image, text, button) on the very top of the page. It's fully responsive and therefore covers all screensizes. The text is black per default but in case of dark pictures, you may want to use white color for M/L views (on S it's always black): put the class name `sc-superhero__content--light` on `sc-superhero__content` container (see third example).
