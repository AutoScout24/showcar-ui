<h2>Button<span class="status approved">Approved</span></h2>

#### When to use a link or button

A link navigates the user to a new resource, taking them away from the current context. Also internal linking (jumping to another section of the current page) is allowed. The user can trigger to open the link in a new window/tab. Examples:

* Navigate the user to a new page or view
* Change the URL
* Page jumps with internal href attributes
* Deep-link client-rendered applications

A button toggles something in the interface, like a video player; or triggers new content in that same context, like a popup menu. Examples:

* Submit form data
* Opening a modal window
* Triggering a popup menu
* Toggling an interface
* Playing media content

#### Usage information

* Bob: Primary button, used for the most important interaction.
* Ross: Secondary button, used for important interactions.
* Ghost Bob: Used for less important interactions / to distinguish between the two most important interactions on a page (e.g. send e-mail and call button on the detailpage). Also useful when you need lots of them on a single page.
* Ghost Ross: Used, if a single link is not prominent enough / too many Ghost Buttons are visually too “heavy”.
* Marketing: For marketing purposes only e.g. banner ads from the marketing department.
