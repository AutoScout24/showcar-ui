<h2>Lazy loading images<span class="status complete">Complete</span></h2>

If you want to make you images lazy, you need to add `lazyload` class to your img tag. We advice you also to add `sc-lazy-image` class. With it you will have a fancy loading spinner when picture is loading. Don't forget to use `data-src` instead of `src` attribute.  
In the example we used ```<img>``` tag. Note the default value for the src. This is needed for ommiting the default view for the "empty" image.
