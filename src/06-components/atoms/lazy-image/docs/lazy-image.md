<h2>Lazy images<span class="status complete">Complete</span></h2>

If you want to make you images lazy, you need to add two classes to you img tag: sc-lazy-image and lazyload. Also you need to use data-src instead of src attribute.
In the example we used ```<img>``` tag. Note the default value for the src. This is needed for ommiting the default view for the "empty" image.
