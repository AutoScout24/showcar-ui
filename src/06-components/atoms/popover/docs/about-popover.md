<h2>Popover<span class="status review">Needs Review</span></h2>
<p>Popover component is a small overlay, that opens on demand, without blocking the on-page interaction. Showcar-UI provides you only with the html structure and the css classes to create the popover overlay. Triggering it (closing & opening) should be done on your own. The popover should be opened below the trigger. For the positioning of the Arrow (Left, Center, Right) please use the provided classes. Feel free to overwrite the position the popover on your page as needed with css.</p>
<p>NOTE: when triggering the popover please add the ARIA accessability attribute to it's trigger: aria-expanded = true or false. For more info please refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_aria-expanded_to_indicate_the_state_of_a_collapsible_element" target="_blank">w3 wiki</a></p>
