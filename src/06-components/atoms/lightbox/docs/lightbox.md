In order to link a trigger element like a button that opens the lightbox you need to provide an `id` for the lightbox 
and add the `data-lightbox-open="ID"` to your trigger element.

For closing you can add the `data-lightbox-close` attribute to any element that should trigger closing of the lightbox.
