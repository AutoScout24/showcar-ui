<h2>Responsive images - art direction<span class="status complete">Complete</span></h2>

Art direction - cropping the image differently on diffrent. E.g. hero image that contains text and providing a smaller version of the image wonâ€™t work because the text will be unreadable.  
Use `<picture>` tag.
