<h2>Responsive images - art direction<span class="status approved">Approved</span></h2>

Art direction - cropping the image differently in diffrent device resolutions. It is used when providing a smaller version of the image wonâ€™t work because text or other small elements will be unreadable (e.g. hero image).  
Use `<picture>` tag.
